                NF on June 27, and "Time" on July 12. The Search was released on July 26.
                On December 3, 2019, Feuerstein released the single "Paid My Dues", as well as a music video for the song.
                In October 2020, NF returned with the non-album single, "Chasing_(Demo)", after sharing a snippet of it online. 
                The song features 15-year-old Australian fan Mikayla Sippel, who uploaded a cover of it, 
                which inspired NF to officially release the song after being "blown away" by her version.
                On February 18, 2021, NF released the single "Clouds", alongside a music video, and announced his
                mixtape of the same name, which was scheduled for a March 26, 2021, release. 
                The mixtape included "Paid My Dues", as well as guest appearances from rappers Hopsin (Lost/LOST) and Tech N9ne 
                (Trust/TRUST), followed by a third single, "Lost" featuring Hopsin, released on March 11, 2021.
                On March 26, 2021, Clouds (The Mixtape) was released.
                After a year-long absence from music, NF released a single "Hope" on February 16, 2023, 
                announcing his fifth studio album of the same name. He released another single entitled "Motto" 
                on March 9, 2023. Hope was released on April 7, 2023, along with the music video for the single "Happy".
